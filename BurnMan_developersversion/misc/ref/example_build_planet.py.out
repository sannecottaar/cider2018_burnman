Planet Zog consists of 4 layers:
The inner core is made of Fe_Dewaele with user-defined temperatures and self-consistent pressures
The outer core is made of Liquid_Fe_Anderson with user-defined temperatures and self-consistent pressures
The lower mantle is made of Mg_Perovskite with adiabatic temperatures and self-consistent pressures
The upper mantle is made of Forsterite with adiabatic temperatures and self-consistent pressures
