Warning from file 'BURNMAN/burnman/mineral.py', line 195:
You are trying to calculate shear modulus for SiO2_liquid when it is exactly zero. 
If SiO2_liquid is a liquid, then you can safely ignore this warning, but consider 
calculating bulk modulus or bulk sound rather than Vp or Vs. 
If SiO2_liquid is not a liquid, then shear modulus calculations for the 
underlying equation of state (DKS_L) have not been implemented, 
and Vp and Vs estimates will be incorrect.
