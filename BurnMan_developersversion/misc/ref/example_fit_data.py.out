1) Fitting shear modulus and its derivative to shear wave velocity data

2nd order fit:
G_0: (1.68 +/- 0.02) x 1e+11
Gprime_0: (1.51 +/- 0.02) x 1e+00

3rd order fit:
G_0: (1.63 +/- 0.02) x 1e+11
Gprime_0: (1.65 +/- 0.02) x 1e+00

2) Fitting standard enthalpy and heat capacity to enthalpy data

Optimised values:
H_0: (-6.0065 +/- 0.0006) x 1e+05
Cp_a: (6 +/- 1) x 1e+01
Cp_b: (0.000 +/- 0.004) x 1e+00
Cp_c: (-5 +/- 6) x 1e+05
Cp_d: (-3 +/- 3) x 1e+02
